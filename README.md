# MineSweeper_Game

A basic minesweeper game built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

You have a 9*9 grid which makes a total of 81 boxes.
<br>
Out of these 81 boxes 10 boxes contain bomb and other boxes are normal.<br>
If a normal box is clicked, the user is awarded a point and if a user clicks on a
box containing a bomb, the game gets over (GAME OVER!) and we have an option to the user to start a fresh game.
